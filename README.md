# E-commerce

## Description

Creating this basic e-commerce site improved my understanding of the MERN Stack.
- I practiced CRUD operations with MongoDB and Express.
- I learned more about creating reusable React components and passing props.
- Also, this tutorial helped me understand state and how to use Redux in a React app.
